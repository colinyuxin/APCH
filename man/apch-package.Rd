\title{apch: Adaptive Partial Conjunction Hypotheses Model}
\description{
Two-layer hierarchical framework for multi-trait (or multi-feature) association analysis with adaptive shrinkage at the feature level and block-diagonal EM at the configuration level. Supports correlated features, grid distillation, and parallel execution.
}
\section{Main features}{

\itemize{
\item Fast log-likelihood computation with parallel processing (RcppParallel)
\item Hierarchical posterior inference via EM-style algorithms
\item Adaptive shrinkage and correlation modeling
\item Integration with ashr and future for distributed computation
}
}

\section{C++ integration}{

C++ code is used for computationally intensive matrix operations,
using Eigen for linear algebra and RcppParallel for multi-threading.
